# Data structures and algorithms

There are a written exercises on topics :
- A dynamical growing DS (vector, linked list, double-linked list and different modes of them)
- A DS adapters (queue, dequeue and different modes of them)
- A standart methods of sort (a quadratic sorts (bubble, insertion, selection), a N*(logN) sorts (heap, quick, merge)
- A standart methods of search (linear, binary)
- An advanced DS to search, retrieve and add data (different types of trees, binary tree, heap)
